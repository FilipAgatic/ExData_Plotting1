## Project description
The scripts in this project are used to generate some exploratory plots using base graphics in R. 
## Introduction

This assignment uses data from
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning
datasets. In particular, we will be using the "Individual household
electric power consumption Data Set" which can be found on
the course web site:


* <b>Dataset</b>: <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> [20Mb]

* <b>Description</b>: Measurements of electric power consumption in
one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost
4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values
are available.


The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken
from
the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption">UCI
web site</a>:

<ol>
<li><b>Date</b>: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy </li>
<li><b>Time</b>: time in format hh:mm:ss </li>
<li><b>Global_active_power</b>: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt) </li>
<li><b>Global_reactive_power</b>: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt) </li>
<li><b>Voltage</b>: minute-averaged voltage (in volt) </li>
<li><b>Global_intensity</b>: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere) </li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_1</b>: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered). </li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_2</b>: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light. </li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_3</b>: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.</li>
</ol>

## Using the scripts
In order to successfully generate your plots, navigate to a working directory that contains the household_power_consumption file. All of the plots are using only the dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02 from the original data set. The time and date variables are converted to an appopriate date-time form and the other variables to numeric. 

### Plot1.R
Creates a simple histogram of global avarege power. 

### Plot2.R
Creates a graph of global average power over time.

### Plot3.R
Creates a plot for all 3 sub metering values over time. 

### Plot4.R 
Creates a 2x2 grid of subplots:
1) Global active power over time
2) Voltage over time
3) sub metering over time
4) Global reactive power over time



The four plots that are generated by the scripts: 


### Plot 1


![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2](figure/Plot1.png) 


### Plot 2

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3](figure/Plot2.png) 


### Plot 3

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4](figure/Plot3.png) 


### Plot 4
